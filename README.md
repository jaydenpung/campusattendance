Explanations  
1) This project is mainly made by scaffolding, so the only manual work done is on designing the object classes. This can be found in "campusAttendance/grails-app/domain/campusattendance". The code for object class is fairly simple, and can be viewed together with the database schema generated to have a better understanding.  
2) You may ignore User.groovy and UserRole.groovy, as these two are auto generated by springsecurity, a plugin that handles the website login and authentication.  
3) Other than object classes, there are minor changes to the views folder in "campusAttendance/grails-app/views" generated by scaffolding, mainly to rearrange the form view (eg. Put the name field before age field etc"  
4) All other codes are generated by grails scaffolding by running the command   
	grails generate-all className
